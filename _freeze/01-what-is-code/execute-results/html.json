RStudio is a very powerful environment that has lots\nof capabilities. We will learn many of these as we go, so right now we\nare going to focus on the most important aspects!\n\n## RStudio Layout\n\nWhen you open RStudio on your computer, you should get something that\nlooks like the image below. You should see **three** panes, two on the\nright hand side and one on the left. Let's learn what these do!\n\n<!-- Need to update to not have the editor pane (since they won't have that open yet) -->\n\n![Important locations and buttons in\nRStudio.](images/01-rstudio-three-pane-annotated.png){#fig-rstudio-three-pane\nfig-alt=\"A screenshot of an RStudio window highlighting the three different panes that open by default. The first pane (on the left hand side) is called the 'Console Pane.' This is the pane where the code you run shows up! In the upper right hand corner, there is the 'Environment and History Pane,' which is comprised of four tabs---Environment, History, Connections, and Tutorial. The Environment tab displays the objects that have been created in your code and the History tab displays a history of the code you've run. In the lower right corner there is the 'Files, Packages, and Help Pane,' which has six different tabs---Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer, and Presentations. The file tab is displayed in the image, showing that (by default), the files will show you your current working directory. For this computer, that current working directory is the Macbook Hard Drive (similar to a PC's C drive).\"}\n\nOn the left, you will find the Console pane. The Console is where you\nwill see your code execute! In the top right, you can find the\nEnvironment and History tabs. These tabs show any objects you've created\nand a history of the code you ran. In the bottom right, you will find\nthe Files, Help, and Packages tabs. These tabs allow you to access files\non your computer, install and load packages, and access documentation\n(help) pages for functions you might be trying to use.\n\n<!-- You do not need to know what all of these tabs do right now. For the moment,  -->\n\n<!-- it's enough to get a sense of the basics. You can see what code was run and the -->\n\n<!-- output of the code in the bottom left), you can navigate to files in the  -->\n\n<!-- bottom right, and you can monitor what objects were created by your code in the -->\n\n<!-- top right. -->\n\n# What is code?\n\n## What makes R different?\n\nR is a statistical programming language. Unlike more general-purpose languages,\nR is optimized for working with data and doing statistics. R was created by Ross\nIhaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993 (hence \"R\") and was formally released by the\n**R Core Group** in 1997 (a group of 20-ish volunteers who are the *only* people\nwho can change the base, built-in functionality of `R`). If you want to build\nan independent, standalone graphical interface, or run a web server, R is\nprobably not the ideal language to use (you might want C / Python or PHP /\nPython, respectively). If you want to vacuum up a bunch of data, fit several\nregression models, and then compare the models, R is a great option and will be\nfaster than working in a more general-purpose language like C or base Python.\n\nOne thing to know about `R` is that it is **open-source**. This means that no\ncompany owns `R` (like there is for *SAS* or *Matlab*) and that developers\ncannot charge for the use of their R software. This does not mean that all of\nyour code needs to be public (you can keep your code private), but it is\nimportant to be a good open-source citizen by sharing your code publicly when\npossible (in STAT 3820 you will learn about *GitHub*), contributing to public\nprojects and packages, creating your own packages, and using `R` for ethical and\nrespectful projects.\n\n### 📖 [Required Reading: Basics of R](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-basics)\n\n::: callout-note\n# The History of `R`\n\nIf you would like to learn more about the history of R, here is an [excellent article written by Roger Peng](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/history-and-overview-of-r.html).\n:::\n\n# Running Code (in the Console)\n\nWhen you open RStudio, the console pane should display information\nrelated to your R session. You should see something like the message\ndisplayed below. This message tells you two things (1) R was\nsuccessfully detected on your computer, and (2) the version of R with\nwhich you are working.\n\n<!-- We will need to update this to the current version of R in August! -->\n\n```         \nR version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31) -- \"[Not] Part in a Rumble\"\nCopyright (C) 2025 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20\n\nR is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.\nYou are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.\nType 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.\n\n  Natural language support but running in an English locale\n\nR is a collaborative project with many contributors.\nType 'contributors()' for more information and\n'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.\n\nType 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or\n'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.\nType 'q()' to quit R.\n```\n\n::: callout-important\nIf you don't see information related to your R session when you open\nRStudio or RStudio tells you it doesn't detect R on your laptop you\neither forgot to install R or installed it in an unexpected location.\n:::\n\n## The Console Tab\n\nIt is possible to run code directly in the console! This code can be\nsimple arithmetic like `2 + 2` or `3 * 6` or `6 - 4`. The output of each\nline is showed below (e.g, `[1] 4`). Next week we will learn what the\n`[1]` means with the output, so for now we will focus on the number that\nis output.\n\n![](images/01-rstudio-console-annotated.png){fig-alt=\"An annotated screenshot of the RStudio console. The top of the image shows three tabs: Console, Terminal, Background Jobs. The Console tab is shown. Immediately below the Console tab you can see the R logo immediately next to the version of R that is being used (4.5.2). The top of the Console output shows the standard text related to R, the version number and name, the copywrite information, the license information, and how to cite R. After this you see a > character (indicating the start of a line of code) with 2+2 next to it. Immediately below this line is the output, displaying the number 4. The next line shows another > (indicating the start of another line of code) and 3*6. The output below this line shows 18. Finally, the third line of code (after another > character) shows 6-4, with an output of 2. The annotation says that the Console shows code that was run and that the > symbol means that R is ready to run code.\"}\n\n::: callout-practice-exercise\nRun these same three lines of code in your console.\n:::\n\n## Creating Objects\n\nIt seems a bit silly to use R as a calculator when it can do so much\nmore for us! A key aspect of working in R is the idea of storing values\ninto objects. When storing a value into an object, your code will look\nsomething like this: `x <- 5`\n\nBelieve it or not, there is a lot going on in this simple line of code.\nSo, let's break it down.\n\n<!-- From Advanced R: the object, or value, doesn’t have a name; it’s actually the name that has a value. -->\n\n-   `x` is the name of the object we are creating\n-   `5` is the value we want to store inside `x`\n-   `<-` is an operator that binds the name `x` to the value `5`\n\nThe `<-` works similar to an `=` sign, but we are specifically using an\n`<-` because we believe it makes the action of assignment more explicit.\n\n::: callout-practice-exercise\nCreate two objects in your console, one named `x` which has the value\n`3` stored in it and one named `y` which has the value `4` stored in it.\n:::\n\nYou should have noticed when you created `x` and `y` that the values are not\nprinted, they are just stored. If you want to view the value, you would need \nto type `x` to see its contents.\n\n### Environment tab\n\nNow that you've created two objects, there are some interesting things\nto notice in the upper right corner. The Environment tab displays any\nobjects which are defined in memory. Currently, both objects you've\ncreated should be labeled \"Values\", but later on we will start to see\nobjects labeled \"Data\" and \"Functions\".\n\n![](images/01-rstudio-environment-annotated.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of the environment pane after creating the objects x and y. A Orange box is drawn around the names x and y with the annotation 'object name' and a second box is drawn around the values 3 and 4 with an annotation 'object value'. The screenshot also highlights the broom icon with a red box drawn around it, and an annotation indicating that this icon will remove all the objects from the environment.\"}\n\n## The History Tab (Top Right)\n\nAnother useful tab in this pane is the History tab, which shows you a\nrunning list of every command you've ever run. At this point you should\nhave run (at least) five lines of code, all of which should be displayed\nin the history.\n\n![](images/01-rstudio-history-annotated.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of the history pane. This pane preserves all commands that have been run from the console or from evaluating code cells or scripts. The image highlights the broom icon in a red box and an accompanying annotation stating that this icon will clear the history (of the code that has been run).\"}\n\n## Updating Objects\n\nCurrently, the values of `x` and `y` are `3` and `4` respectively, but\nwe might need to update their values. If we want to change the values of\n`x` or `y`, we simply need to assign them new values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 8\nz <- x + y\ny <- 5\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-practice-exercise\n\nCode tracing is a great technique for understanding what happens to an\nobject at each line of code. Use the table below to trace the values \nof `x`, `y`, and `z` for each of the three lines of code above.\n\n<!-- Is there a way to make this interactive? -->\n<!-- Maybe do multiple choice questions with webR? -->\n\n| Line   | `x`    | `y`     | `z`                   |\n|--------|:------:|:-------:|:---------------------:|\n| Line 1 |        |  4      |   Does not exist      |\n| Line 2 |        |         |                       |\n| Line 3 |        |         |                       |\n:::\n\n# Saving Your Code\n\nThis process of updating objects in the console seems a bit tedious and error \nprone. If we made a mistake we can't modify our previous code, so we will need\nto write another line of code. Moreover, it would be a bit tedious to get a\nhistory of all the code we ran. Enter R scripts! \n\n## Scripts\n\nAn R script is a document that can store your code! Specifically, an R script is\na plain text file whose entire purpose is to store R commands. Instead of typing\ncode line-by-line into the console, we can write our code in a script, save it,\nand run it whenever we need.\n\nWorking in an R script has several advantages. First, it allows us to easily\nedit and fix mistakes without rewriting code from scratch. Second, scripts\nprovide a complete record of the steps we took to perform an analysis, making\nour work easier to understand, reproduce, and share with others (or with our\nfuture selves!). Finally, scripts help us organize our code, encouraging clearer\nstructure, comments, and good programming habits as our projects grow.\n\nLet's create our first R script!\n\n### Creating an R Script\n\nIn the upper left hand corner, you should see an image of a white sheet with a \ngreen plus sign. If you click this button you should see something like the \nimage below:\n\n![](images/01-rstudio-create-script-annotated.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of RStudio showing how to create a new R script. The green “New File” button in the top-left toolbar is highlighted. Its dropdown menu is open, and the “R Script” option is highlighted, indicating that students should click “New File” and then select “R Script” to create a new script.\"}\n\nIf you click on the R Script option, a new file should appear and your RStudio \nshould look something like this:\n\n![](images/01-rstudio-r-script.png){fig-alt=\"A screenshot of a blank R script. In the top left corner, you can read the file name 'Untitled1'. Immediately below this, there are a few icons, a floppy disk (for saving the file), a check box saying 'Source on Save', a magnifying glass, and a magical wand. On the right hand side there are two other icons, Run (to run a line of code) and Source.\"}\n\n::: callout-practice-exercise\nCreate an R Script in your RStudio!\n:::\n\n### The Editor Pane\n\nNow that we have a document to edit, we can see the fourth pane in RStudio---the\neditor pane. There are many different files we can create in RStudio. The \nlogo in the top left of the document indicates the type of file we have open. \nAn R script file has a blue circle with the letter R. \n\nLet's start typing in the script, so we can explore some of the other buttons \navailable to us. \n\n### Running Code\n\nCopy the code below into your R script, so we can explore the various ways to \nrun code. \n\n```\na <- 1\nb <- 4\nc <- a + b\n\nfname <- \"Jane\"\nlname <- \"Hollander\"\n```\n\nNow that we have code in the script we can see that code numbers are provided on\nthe left. This is a handy way to see where in the code the errors occur. There\nare a few ways to run code:\n\n1. place your cursor on the line you want to run and click the [run button](images/01-rstudio-run-code.png){fig-alt=\"A screenshot of the run button shown on the top right of the R script. The icon has a white box with a green arrow pointing to the right with the text saying 'Run' on the right.\"}\n\n2. place your cursor on the line you want to run and hit Command + Enter (or\nControl + Enter)\n\nEither of these options will run the line of code that your cursor is on and\nthen hop to the next line (if there is one). \n\n::: callout-practice-exercise\nRun each of the five lines of code in your R script. Try both methods of running\ncode and see which one you prefer!\n:::\n\n### Saving Your R Script \n\nYou'll notice that currently your script is labeled \"Untitled1\" that is because\nwe haven't saved the file anywhere. If we were to try and close our file before\nsaving RStudio would tell us that our document had unsaved changes. Let's save \nour document so we have access to it later on!\n\n![](images/01-rstudio-unsaved-changes.png){fig-alt=\"A screenshot of the popup that appears when you attempt to close RStudio without saving your R script. The popup says 'The document Untitled1 has unsaved changes. Do you want to save these changes. The options provided are 'Save' (in blue), 'Don't Save', and 'Cancel.' The save button is what should be selected.\"}\nYou can save your file a few different ways. First, you can always use Command + S (or Control + S) to save a file. Second, you can click on the [blue floppy disk](images/01-rstudio-save.png){fig-alt=\"A screenshot of the blue floppy disk icon that lives on the top left below the file name.\"} immediately below your file name. \n\nEither of these options should open a popup menu for you to select where you\nwant the script to be saved. Navigate to your `stat-1810` folder that lives in\nyour `Documents` folder. Change the file name to `week-1.R`.\n\n<!-- ### Files tab -->\n\n<!-- ![The files tab shows you the files in your current working directory (by default), though you can navigate through it and find other files as necessary. If you want to return to your working directory, there's a button for that in the \"More\" menu. One of the most important pieces of information in this pane is your path - you can construct the file path by using ~/ for home, and then for each folder, adding a slash between. The path to the folder we're looking at here is thus `~/Projects/Class/stat-computing-r-python/`.](../images/tools/Rstudio-file-tab.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of RStudio file tab, showing files, size, and last modified date. The folder path is shown just below the icon row and can be useful if you don't know where your files are located.\"} -->\n\n<!-- ## Writing Code for People -->\n\n<!-- One problem with scripts and interactive modes of using programming languages is that we’re spending most of our time writing code for computers to read – which doesn’t necessarily imply that our code is easy for humans to read. As you become more proficient at programming, you will realize quickly that writing readable code is more challenging than writing working code. It is hard to remember what a specific block of code did when you come back to it months after you wrote it! -->\n\n<!-- There are two solutions to this problem, and I encourage you to make liberal use of both of them (together). -->\n\n<!-- Code Comments -->\n\n<!-- A comment is a part of computer code which is intended only for people to read. It is not evaluated or run by the computing language. -->\n\n<!-- ## Exiting RStudio -->\n<!-- Need to update global options to not save Rdata! -->\n",
