In this class, we will primarily focus on working with what we call *rectangular data* meaning that the data is two-dimentional with rows and columns. With rectangular data, each *row* represents one observation (or observational unit) and each *column* represents a *variable*.\n\nThere are also multiple ways that rectangular data can be stored in R! We will primarily work with `data.frame()` and `tibble()` ojects. It is important to know the type and format of the data you're working with! It is much easier to create data visualizations or conduct statistical analyses if the data you use is in the right shape. \n\nIn a perfect world, all data would come in the right format for our needs, but this is often not the case. We will spend the next few weeks learning about how to use R to read in data and reformat our data so that it can be used in a specific analysis.\n\n\n\n### Data Frames in R\n\nData frames are a specific object type in R, `data.frame()`, and can be indexed the same as matrices. It may be useful to actually look at your data before beginning to work with it to see the format of the data. The following functions in R help us learn information about our data sets:\n\n+ `class()`: outputs the object type\n+ `names()`: outputs the variable (column) names\n+ `head()`: outputs the first 6 rows of a dataframe\n+ `glimpse()` or `str()`: output a transpose of dataframe or matrix; shows the data types\n+ `summary()` outputs 6-number summaries or frequencies for all variables in the data set depending on the variables data type\n+ `data$variable`: extracts a specific variable (column) from the data set\n\nYou may also choose to click on the data set name in your Environment window pane in R and the data set will pop up in a new tab in the script pane.\n\nLet's start with looking at a dataset that is included in a *package* in R. \n\nThe `cereal` dataset is included in the `liver` package. To open this dataset, we nead to load the package `liver` first, and then we can use the `data()` function to look at the `cereal` data.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load liver package\nlibrary(liver)\n\n# load cereal data which is included in the package\ndata(cereal)\n\n# look at the first couple of rows\nhead(cereal)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                       name manuf type calories protein fat sodium fiber carbo\n1                 100% Bran     N cold       70       4   1    130  10.0   5.0\n2         100% Natural Bran     Q cold      120       3   5     15   2.0   8.0\n3                  All-Bran     K cold       70       4   1    260   9.0   7.0\n4 All-Bran with Extra Fiber     K cold       50       4   0    140  14.0   8.0\n5            Almond Delight     R cold      110       2   2    200   1.0  14.0\n6   Apple Cinnamon Cheerios     G cold      110       2   2    180   1.5  10.5\n  sugars potass vitamins shelf weight cups   rating\n1      6    280       25     3      1 0.33 68.40297\n2      8    135        0     3      1 1.00 33.98368\n3      5    320       25     3      1 0.33 59.42551\n4      0    330       25     3      1 0.50 93.70491\n5      8     -1       25     3      1 0.75 34.38484\n6     10     70       25     1      1 0.75 29.50954\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# get a summary of the data\nstr(cereal)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n'data.frame':\t77 obs. of  16 variables:\n $ name    : Factor w/ 77 levels \"100% Bran\",\"100% Natural Bran\",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ manuf   : Factor w/ 7 levels \"A\",\"G\",\"K\",\"N\",..: 4 6 3 3 7 2 3 2 7 5 ...\n $ type    : Factor w/ 2 levels \"cold\",\"hot\": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ calories: int  70 120 70 50 110 110 110 130 90 90 ...\n $ protein : int  4 3 4 4 2 2 2 3 2 3 ...\n $ fat     : int  1 5 1 0 2 2 0 2 1 0 ...\n $ sodium  : int  130 15 260 140 200 180 125 210 200 210 ...\n $ fiber   : num  10 2 9 14 1 1.5 1 2 4 5 ...\n $ carbo   : num  5 8 7 8 14 10.5 11 18 15 13 ...\n $ sugars  : int  6 8 5 0 8 10 14 8 6 5 ...\n $ potass  : int  280 135 320 330 -1 70 30 100 125 190 ...\n $ vitamins: int  25 0 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 ...\n $ shelf   : int  3 3 3 3 3 1 2 3 1 3 ...\n $ weight  : num  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.33 1 1 ...\n $ cups    : num  0.33 1 0.33 0.5 0.75 0.75 1 0.75 0.67 0.67 ...\n $ rating  : num  68.4 34 59.4 93.7 34.4 ...\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-check-in .icon}\n1. What does a *row* in the data represent?\n\n2. What kinds of *variables* are available in the data? How many are there?\n\n3. What questions do you have about the variables after just looking at the data?\n:::\n\nJust looking at a data frame in R, we can't tell how the variables are measures and what they all mean! We will always want to look at a **data dictionary** to understand what the columns really mean. Any good data provider should provide a data dictionary along with the data!\n\nIn this case, we can find the data dictionary in the help file for the data in R by running:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?cereal\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-check-in .icon}\n1. According to the data dictionary, what does a row represent in the data?\n\n2. What does the variable `shelf` measure and what are the possible values? Should this be treated as a categorical or a numeric variable?\n\n3. What is the unit for the `sodium` variable? What about `fiber`?\n:::\n\n\n## Reading in Data\n\nIn order to use statistical software to do anything interesting, we need to be able to get data into the program so that we can work with it effectively. \n\n\n\n### File Paths\n\nBefore we can read in data, we need to tell R where to look for the data file!\n\nA **file path** describes where a certain file or directory lives on your computer. Any time that you are working in R, there is a *working directory*, which is the baseline directory that R is then looking for other files from. You can find your current working directory with:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetwd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"/Users/czmann/Documents/r-revamp/course-pack\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two different kinds of file paths that you can define to indicate the location of a file or directory:\n\n- **absolute file path**: full path from the root directory on *your* computer. Note this will only work on your computer!\n\n- **relative file path**: path based on the relationship with a current *working directory* in terms of a hierarchichy of directories \n \nLet's look at an example of relative versus absolute file paths. In the example below the \"labs\" directory is the working directory. The directories that \"labs\" are in are called it's *parent* directories, which are referenced with `\"../\"` in the relative file paths.\n\n![](images/04-relative-absolute.png)\n\n\n:::callout-important\nSince absolute file paths **only** work on **your computer**, we will **always use relative file paths** in this course.\n:::\n\n### Types of Data Files\n\nWe will also need to tell R what kind of data it an expect. In this class, are focusing on rectangular data, with rows indicating observations and columns that show variables.  This type of data can be stored on the computer in multiple ways which indicate rows and columns in different ways:\n\n- **as raw text**, usually in a file that ends with `.txt`, `.tsv`, `.csv`, `.dat`, or sometimes, there will be no file extension at all. \n  + `.csv` \"Comma-separated\"\n  + `.txt` plain text\n    + rows will always be separated in new lines\n    + columns can be separated with different *delimiters* including tabs, spaces, commas, or other delimeters\n\n- **in a spreadsheet**. Spreadsheets, such as those created by MS Excel, Google Sheets use a special type of markup that is specific to the filetype and the program it's designed to work with. Therefore, special functionality is required for working with them in R.\n  + `.xls`\n  + `.xlsx`\n\nTo work with data in R, it's important to know how to read in text files (CSV, tab-delimited, etc.). It can be helpful to also know how to read in XLSX files. \n\nLet's practice recognizing different kinds of data files.\n\n:::{.callout-check-in .icon}\nWhat kind of data file are each of the following? Note what kind of *delimeter* is used to separate columns.\n:::\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### File A\n\n![](images/04-csv-file.png)\n\n\n### File B\n\n![](images/04-tsv-file.png)\n\n### File C\n\n![](images/04-pipe-file.png)\n\n### Sources\n\n-   [File A](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html)\n-   [File B](https://github.com/ccusa/Disaster_Vulnerability_Map/blob/master/sample-data.tsv)\n-   [File C](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/24/quick-parse-csv-file.html)\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: there are a lot of other ways to store data that we just won't talk about in this class!\n\n\n### Reading in Data with `readr` and `readxl`\n\n+ `read_csv()` is for reading in .csv files\n+ `read_txv()` is for tab-separated data\n+ `read_table()` is for any data with \"columns\" (white space separating)\n+ `read_delim()` is for special \"delimiters\" separating data\n+ `read_xlsx()` is specifically for dealing with Excel files\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load the readr package (or alternatively the tidyverse package)\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# here we are using a URL\nsurveys <- read_csv(file = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earobinson95/stat331-calpoly/master/lab-assignments/Lab2-graphics/surveys.csv\")\n\n# here is an example of a relative file path to an actual data file!\nsurveys <- read_csv(file = \"../data/surveys.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- ### RStudio Projects -->\n\n<!-- When you work on a project that may need to exist on some other machine, it's important to use **local** file paths -- the global path will likely not be the same, but you can usually set the local project-specific structure up to be the same across machines.  -->\n\n<!-- In fact, there's a very common shortcut that programmers take -- they set up a project-specific folder that is self contained.  -->\n<!-- That is, all of the data and code necessary for that project is provided within the folder.  -->\n<!-- Then, the code within the folder can use local paths and will work when the project folder is copied to a new machine.  -->\n\n<!-- (Allison) I'm not quite sure where this should go, but we will need to \nintroduce packages in this lesson. -->\n\n<!-- ### Packages tab -->\n\n<!-- R and python both work off of packages - extensions to the default language that make it easier to accomplish certain tasks, like reading data from Excel files or drawing pretty charts.  -->\n<!-- This tab shows all of the R packages you have installed on your machine, and which ones are currently loaded. -->\n\n<!-- ![You can get important information from the packages tab, like what packages are loaded, easy access to documentation for each package, and what version of the package is installed.](../images/tools/Rstudio-packages-tab.png){fig-alt=\"Packages tab of RStudio.
