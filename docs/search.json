In part two of the coursework, you will learn good practices for managing and storing files for this course.\nBefore you learn how to program, it can be helpful to learn a few simple things about how computers work. Modern computers hide a lot of the about where and how files are stored, but later in the course when you start writing programs these details will suddenly become very important.\nThe components that make up the physical computer are the hardware. This 3-minute video is focused on desktops, but the same components are commonly found in laptops, cell phones, and even smart watches.",

This 2-minute video describes different operating systems.\n\n\n\nBroadly, you should know (1) what operating system your computer uses (Windows / Mac / Linux), and (2) what version of the system your computer uses (e.g. Windows 11, Mac OSX Tahoe, Debian 12, RedHat 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipLearn About Your Computer\n\n\n\nLocate your operating system and version information. When was your system last updated?\nIf your system hasn’t been updated in a while, consider updating it now. System updates may break software you’ll install to work with R in the next few weeks.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 File Systems\nFile systems are places you save files (shocking!). These systems are modeled after physical file cabinets, where documents are kept in a hierarchical sequence of folders. This collection of folders is what is stored on your hard drive.\nThere has been a generational shift in how computers are used. Older users (like me!) were taught to organize files deliberately, while many newer users rely almost entirely on search, treating their computers less like filing cabinets and more like laundry hampers.\nRegardless of how you tend to organize your personal files, it is helpful to understand the basics of what is meant by a computer file system–a way to organize data stored on a hard drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteYou can stop watching at 4:16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s not enough, though - we also need to know how computers remember the location of what is stored where. Specifically, we need to understand file paths.\n\n\n\nWhen you write a program, you may have to reference external files - data stored in a .csv file, for instance, or a picture. Best practice is to create a file structure that contains everything you need to run your entire project in a single file folder (you can, and sometimes should, have sub-folders).\nFor now, it is enough to know how to find files using file paths, and how to refer to a file using a relative file path from your base folder. In this situation, your “base folder” is known as your working directory - the place your program thinks of as home.\nIn Chapter 1, we will discuss Directories, Paths, and Projects as they relate to R and getting setup to be successful in this course.",

In fact, there seems to be a growing trend for files to be exclusively stored on a cloud-based service rather than locally, and, unfortunately, it can be difficult to override these defaults.\nWhen programming, it is essential to know where your files are being stored. In Week 4 when we start reading in data, you will not be able to interactively search for where the data are stored. Instead, you will need to know the exact location of the data on your computer. For this class, we strongly prefer for files to be stored locally because working “in the cloud” can cause strange errors that are difficult to diagnose.",

    "text": "2.3 File Paths\nIt’s not enough to know about a computer’s file system, we also need to know how computers remember the location of what is stored where. Specifically, we need to understand file paths.\n\n\n\nWhen you write a program, you may have to reference external files - data stored in a .csv file, for instance, or a picture. To reference a file, you have to tell the computer where to look. Meaning, you need to give the computer a file path. There are two types of file paths:\n\nglobal file path: Starts at the root of the file system location (e.g., C:\\ or /home or /Users) and describes how to navigate to the file from the root.\nlocal file path: Starts at the program’s current location (e.g., Documents, Desktop) and navigates to the file from that location.\n\nThe best practice for file storage is to create a folder that contains everything you need to run your entire project. This folder can (and should!) have sub-folders. This might look something like this:\n- Documents\n    - stat-1810\n        + Week 1\n            * Lecture\n            * Lab\n        + Week 2\n            * Lecture\n            * Lab\n        + Week 3\n            * Lecture\n            * Lab\n        + Week 4\n            * Lecture\n            * Project\n        + .Rproj\nFor now, it is enough to know how to find files using file paths, and how to refer to a file using a relative file path from your base folder. In this example, the “base folder” would be stat-1810. In Week 4 we will learn about RStudio projects (.Rproj), a tool for setting the base folder of a project without having to write any code!\n\n2.3.1 Making Good File Names\nYou might have noticed a few things about how we chose to name the folders in the previous example. First, the main folder was named stat-1810 not Stat-1810 or Stat 1810. We made this choice for two reasons:\n\nSome computers are case sensitive, so it is safer to use the same capitalization for all folders. stat is easier to type than Stat or STAT.\nUsing spaces in file names (e.g., stat 1810) can sometimes cause issues. So, we advocate for replacing spaces with a hyphon or an underscore.\n\n\n\n\nDifferent operating systems (and file system formats) have different rules for how file names are handled within the file system.\n\nFile Naming Rules: Each operating system has characters that cannot be used and different behavior for case sensitivity.\n\n\n\nWindows \nMac OSX \nLinux \n\n\n\n\nDisallowed Characters\n&lt;, &gt;, \", /, \\, |, ?, *\n:, some programs will restrict use of / . Avoid names that start with . unless the file should be hidden.\nNULL character, / . Can’t name files . or .. . Avoid \\, \", ', *, ;, ?, [, ], (, ), ~, !, $, &lt;, &gt;, #, @, &, |, spaces, tabs, and newlines. Avoid names that start with . unless the file should be hidden.\n\n\nCase Sensitive\nNo. A.jpg is the same as a.JPG\nIt’s complicated. Act as if it’s case sensitive to be safe.\nYes. A.jpg is different from a.jpg and A.JPG\n\n\nName Length\nEntire file path should be &lt;256 characters[^01-computer-basics-4].\n(For HFS+ systems) File names &lt; 255 characters. File paths can be longer.\nFile names &lt; 255 characters, File paths &lt; 4096 characters (most file system options, including ext4)\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve learned about file paths and names, let’s create a folder for this course!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-inCheck In\n\n\n\nCreate a stat-1810 folder in the Documents folder of your computer. Ensure your folder is stored locally on your computer, not on OneDrive or iCloud!\nTake a screenshot of your class directory, showing:\n\nthe location of your stat-1810 folder\na Week 1 sub-folder",
