In part two of the coursework, you will learn good practices for managing and storing files for this course.\nBefore you learn how to program, it can be helpful to learn a few simple things about how computers work. Modern computers hide a lot of the about where and how files are stored, but later in the course when you start writing programs these details will suddenly become very important.\nThe components that make up the physical computer are the hardware. This 3-minute video is focused on desktops, but the same components are commonly found in laptops, cell phones, and even smart watches.",

    "section": "2.2 File Systems",
    "text": "2.2 File Systems\nFile systems are places you save files (shocking!). These systems are modeled after physical file cabinets, where documents are kept in a hierarchical sequence of folders. This collection of folders is what is stored on your hard drive.\nThere has been a generational shift in how computers are used. Older users (like me!) were taught to organize files deliberately, while many newer users rely almost entirely on search, treating their computers less like filing cabinets and more like laundry hampers.\nRegardless of how you tend to organize your personal files, it is helpful to understand the basics of what is meant by a computer file system–a way to organize data stored on a hard drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can stop watching at 4:16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Local & Network File Systems\nThere are two primary types of file systems:\n\nlocal file storage, where files are physically stored on your computer’s disk.\nnetwork file storage, where files are stored “in the cloud” and you may have a copy on your local machine.\n\nWe have noticed that more and more students have their files stored on cloud-based networks (e.g., Microsoft OneDrive, iCloud) rather than locally. In fact, there seems to be a growing trend for files to be exclusively stored on a cloud-based service rather than locally, and, unfortunately, it can be difficult to override these defaults.\nWhen programming, it is essential to know where your files are being stored. In Week 4 when we start reading in data, you will not be able to interactively search for where the data are stored. Instead, you will need to know the exact location of the data on your computer. For this class, we strongly prefer for files to be stored locally because working “in the cloud” can cause strange errors that are difficult to diagnose.",

    "section": "2.3 File Paths",
    "text": "2.3 File Paths\nIt’s not enough to know about a computer’s file system, we also need to know how computers remember the location of what is stored where. Specifically, we need to understand file paths.\n\n\n\nWhen you write a program, you may have to reference external files - data stored in a .csv file, for instance, or a picture. To reference a file, you have to tell the computer where to look. Meaning, you need to give the computer a file path. There are two types of file paths:\n\nglobal file path: Starts at the root of the file system location (e.g., C:\\ or /home or /Users) and describes how to navigate to the file from the root.\nlocal file path: Starts at the program’s current location (e.g., Documents, Desktop) and navigates to the file from that location.\n\nThe best practice for file storage is to create a folder that contains everything you need to run your entire project. This folder can (and should!) have sub-folders. This might look something like this:\n- Documents\n    - stat-1810\n        + Week 1\n            * Lecture\n            * Lab\n        + Week 2\n            * Lecture\n            * Lab\n        + Week 3\n            * Lecture\n            * Lab\n        + Week 4\n            * Lecture\n            * Project\n        + .Rproj\nFor now, it is enough to know how to find files using file paths, and how to refer to a file using a relative file path from your base folder. In this example, the “base folder” would be stat-1810. In Week 4 we will learn about RStudio projects (.Rproj), a tool for setting the base folder of a project without having to write any code!\n\n2.3.1 Making Good File Names\nYou might have noticed a few things about how we chose to name the folders in the previous example. First, the main folder was named stat-1810 not Stat-1810 or Stat 1810. We made this choice for two reasons:\n\nSome computers are case sensitive, so it is safer to use the same capitalization for all folders. stat is easier to type than Stat or STAT.\nUsing spaces in file names (e.g., stat 1810) can sometimes cause issues. So, we advocate for replacing spaces with a hyphen or an underscore.\n\n\n\n\nDifferent operating systems (and file system formats) have different rules for how file names are handled within the file system.\n\nFile Naming Rules: Each operating system has characters that cannot be used and different behavior for case sensitivity.\n\n\n\nWindows \nMac OSX \nLinux \n\n\n\n\nDisallowed Characters\n&lt;, &gt;, \", /, \\, |, ?, *\n:, some programs will restrict use of / . Avoid names that start with . unless the file should be hidden.\nNULL character, / . Can’t name files . or .. . Avoid \\, \", ', *, ;, ?, [, ], (, ), ~, !, $, &lt;, &gt;, #, @, &, |, spaces, tabs, and newlines. Avoid names that start with . unless the file should be hidden.\n\n\nCase Sensitive\nNo. A.jpg is the same as a.JPG\nIt’s complicated. Act as if it’s case sensitive to be safe.\nYes. A.jpg is different from a.jpg and A.JPG\n\n\nName Length\nEntire file path should be &lt;256 characters[^01-computer-basics-4].\n(For HFS+ systems) File names &lt; 255 characters. File paths can be longer.\nFile names &lt; 255 characters, File paths &lt; 4096 characters (most file system options, including ext4)\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve learned about file paths and names, let’s create a folder for this course!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck In\n\n\n\nCreate a stat-1810 folder in the Documents folder of your computer. Ensure your folder is stored locally on your computer, not on OneDrive or iCloud!\nTake a screenshot of your class directory, showing:\n\nthe location of your stat-1810 folder\na Week 1 sub-folder",

Do not skip this step if you already have both R and RStudio installed on your computer, as you need to ensure you are using the most up to date version of R and RStudio.\nDownload and install R by going to https://cloud.r-project.org/. Here, you will find three options for installing R—click on the option for your computer’s operating system.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 If you are a Windows user:\n\nClick on “Download R for Windows”\nClick on “base”\nClick on the Download link.\nWhen you open the execution file (.exe) you will be prompted with a variety of questions about installing R. Feel free to use the default features / settings that come with R (continue to click “Ok” until the download starts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Versions of R\n\n\n\nBeware that if you had a previous version of R downloaded on your PC, that old version will not be deleted when you download the most recent version of R. We do not want to have two versions of R installed, as your computer can get confused what version of R to use. So, you need to remove the old version of R.\nTo do this you need to:\n\nNavigate to your computer’s settings\nClick on the “Apps” option on the left-hand panel\nSearch for or scroll down to R\nFind the older version of R\n\n\n\nClick on the ... on the right side\nSelect “Uninstall”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 If you are macOS user:\n\nClick on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”\nUnder “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of January 1, 2025 was R-4.5.2 (Not Part in a Rumble).\nWhen installing, use the default features / settings that come with R (click Ok until the download starts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting for Macs\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, identify which version of OSx you are running. How-to\nNext, find out which version of R your computer can run. Link\nIf this version is 3.6 or later, download the latest version that your computer can handle.\nIf this version is 3.4 or earlier, you’re going to run in to some trouble. I recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing. If you can’t, then you can use Posit Cloud to run R and RStudio on a free server. However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not be saved indefinitely, you will have limited hours to complete your work, your computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all times to do your work.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 If you are a Linux user:\nClick on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.",

Back in the dark ages, people wrote programs in text editors and then used the command line to compile those programs and run them. RStudio makes programming in R much easier and this course requires you to use it!\n\n\n\n\nDownloading the most recent version of RStudio works the same way regardless of whether you’ve never downloaded RStudio before or if you just need to update your version of RStudio.\nWhen you navigate to the RStudio download page (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), the website should automatically detect your computer’s operating system. So, you should be able to simply click the blue “Download RStudio Desktop for [insert operating system here]” button.\nClicking the button will begin installing RStudio.
