We will summarize the main concepts in each chapter, show you examples, point you to more in-depth readings from outside sources, and ask you to try out short tasks in R as you go.",

    "text": "2 Hardware\nThe theme of this lesson is understanding the difference between hardware and software, and where things are stored on your computer. In part two of the coursework, you will learn good practices for managing and storing files for this course.\nBefore you learn how to program, it can be helpful to learn a few simple things about how computers work. Modern computers hide a lot of the about where and how files are stored, but later in the course when you start writing programs these details will suddenly become very important.\nThe components that make up the physical computer are the hardware. This 3-minute video is focused on desktops, but the same components are commonly found in laptops, cell phones, and even smart watches.",

    "text": "TipLearn About Your Computer\n\n\n\nExamine the hardware on your computer using one of the following methods:\nWindows: Ctrl+Shift+Escape &gt; Task Manager &gt; More Options &gt; Performance tab\nMac: Apple menu &gt; System Settings &gt; General (sidebar) &gt; About &gt; System Report\n\nFind out:\n\nWhat processor do you have? This most likely will start with ARM, Intel, AMD, or Apple M*\nHow much RAM do you have? (most likely between 8 and 64 GB)\nHow much hard drive space do you have?\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Operating Systems\nOperating systems (OS), such as Windows and MacOS, are sophisticated programs that allow CPUs to keep track of multiple programs and tasks and execute them at the same time. This 2-minute video describes different operating systems.\n\n\n\nBroadly, you should know (1) what operating system your computer uses (Windows / Mac / Linux), and (2) what version of the system your computer uses (e.g. Windows 11, Mac OSX Tahoe, Debian 12, RedHat 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipLearn About Your Computer\n\n\n\nLocate your operating system and version information. When was your system last updated?\nIf your system hasn’t been updated in a while, consider updating it now. System updates may break software you’ll install to work with R in the next few weeks.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 File Systems\nFile systems are places you save files (shocking!). These systems are modeled after physical file cabinets, where documents are kept in a hierarchical sequence of folders. This collection of folders is what is stored on your hard drive.\nThere has been a generational shift in how computers are used. Older users (like me!) were taught to organize files deliberately, while many newer users rely almost entirely on search, treating their computers less like filing cabinets and more like laundry hampers.\nRegardless of how you tend to organize your personal files, it is helpful to understand the basics of what is meant by a computer file system–a way to organize data stored on a hard drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteYou can stop watching at 4:16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s not enough, though - we also need to know how computers remember the location of what is stored where. Specifically, we need to understand file paths.\n\n\n\nWhen you write a program, you may have to reference external files - data stored in a .csv file, for instance, or a picture. Best practice is to create a file structure that contains everything you need to run your entire project in a single file folder (you can, and sometimes should, have sub-folders).\nFor now, it is enough to know how to find files using file paths, and how to refer to a file using a relative file path from your base folder. In this situation, your “base folder” is known as your working directory - the place your program thinks of as home.\nIn Chapter 1, we will discuss Directories, Paths, and Projects as they relate to R and getting setup to be successful in this course.",
