In part two of the coursework, you will learn good practices for managing and storing files for this course.\nBefore you learn how to program, it can be helpful to learn a few simple things about how computers work. Modern computers hide a lot of the about where and how files are stored, but later in the course when you start writing programs these details will suddenly become very important.\nThe components that make up the physical computer are the hardware.

    "section": "2.2 File Systems",
    "text": "2.2 File Systems\nFile systems are places you save files (shocking!). These systems are modeled after physical file cabinets, where documents are kept in a hierarchical sequence of folders. This collection of folders is what is stored on your hard drive.\nThere has been a generational shift in how computers are used. Older users (like me!) were taught to organize files deliberately, while many newer users rely almost entirely on search, treating their computers less like filing cabinets and more like laundry hampers.\nRegardless of how you tend to organize your personal files, it is helpful to understand the basics of what is meant by a computer file system–a way to organize data stored on a hard drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can stop watching at 4:16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Local & Network File Systems\nThere are two primary types of file systems:\n\nlocal file storage, where files are physically stored on your computer’s disk.\nnetwork file storage, where files are stored “in the cloud” and you may have a copy on your local machine.\n\nWe have noticed that more and more students have their files stored on cloud-based networks (e.g., Microsoft OneDrive, iCloud) rather than locally. In fact, there seems to be a growing trend for files to be exclusively stored on a cloud-based service rather than locally, and, unfortunately, it can be difficult to override these defaults.\nWhen programming, it is essential to know where your files are being stored. In Week 4 when we start reading in data, you will not be able to interactively search for where the data are stored. Instead, you will need to know the exact location of the data on your computer. For this class, we strongly prefer for files to be stored locally because working “in the cloud” can cause strange errors that are difficult to diagnose.",

    "section": "2.3 File Paths",
    "text": "2.3 File Paths\nIt’s not enough to know about a computer’s file system, we also need to know how computers remember the location of what is stored where. Specifically, we need to understand file paths.\n\n\n\nWhen you write a program, you may have to reference external files - data stored in a .csv file, for instance, or a picture. To reference a file, you have to tell the computer where to look. Meaning, you need to give the computer a file path. There are two types of file paths:\n\nglobal file path: Starts at the root of the file system location (e.g., C:\\ or /home or /Users) and describes how to navigate to the file from the root.\nlocal file path: Starts at the program’s current location (e.g., Documents, Desktop) and navigates to the file from that location.\n\nThe best practice for file storage is to create a folder that contains everything you need to run your entire project. This folder can (and should!) have sub-folders. This might look something like this:\n- Documents\n    - stat-1810\n        + Week 1\n            * Lecture\n            * Lab\n        + Week 2\n            * Lecture\n            * Lab\n        + Week 3\n            * Lecture\n            * Lab\n        + Week 4\n            * Lecture\n            * Project\n        + .Rproj\nFor now, it is enough to know how to find files using file paths, and how to refer to a file using a relative file path from your base folder. In this example, the “base folder” would be stat-1810. In Week 4 we will learn about RStudio projects (.Rproj), a tool for setting the base folder of a project without having to write any code!\n\n2.3.1 Making Good File Names\nYou might have noticed a few things about how we chose to name the folders in the previous example. First, the main folder was named stat-1810 not Stat-1810 or Stat 1810. We made this choice for two reasons:\n\nSome computers are case sensitive, so it is safer to use the same capitalization for all folders. stat is easier to type than Stat or STAT.\nUsing spaces in file names (e.g., stat 1810) can sometimes cause issues. So, we advocate for replacing spaces with a hyphen or an underscore.\n\n\n\n\nDifferent operating systems (and file system formats) have different rules for how file names are handled within the file system.\n\nFile Naming Rules: Each operating system has characters that cannot be used and different behavior for case sensitivity.\n\n\n\nWindows \nMac OSX \nLinux \n\n\n\n\nDisallowed Characters\n&lt;, &gt;, \", /, \\, |, ?, *\n:, some programs will restrict use of / . Avoid names that start with . unless the file should be hidden.\nNULL character, / . Can’t name files . or .. . Avoid \\, \", ', *, ;, ?, [, ], (, ), ~, !, $, &lt;, &gt;, #, @, &, |, spaces, tabs, and newlines. Avoid names that start with . unless the file should be hidden.\n\n\nCase Sensitive\nNo. A.jpg is the same as a.JPG\nIt’s complicated. Act as if it’s case sensitive to be safe.\nYes. A.jpg is different from a.jpg and A.JPG\n\n\nName Length\nEntire file path should be &lt;256 characters[^01-computer-basics-4].\n(For HFS+ systems) File names &lt; 255 characters. File paths can be longer.\nFile names &lt; 255 characters, File paths &lt; 4096 characters (most file system options, including ext4)\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve learned about file paths and names, let’s create a folder for this course!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck In\n\n\n\nCreate a stat-1810 folder in the Documents folder of your computer. Ensure your folder is stored locally on your computer, not on OneDrive or iCloud!\nTake a screenshot of your class directory, showing:\n\nthe location of your stat-1810 folder\na Week 1 sub-folder",

Do not skip this step if you already have both R and RStudio installed on your computer, as you need to ensure you are using the most up to date version of R and RStudio.\nDownload and install R by going to https://cloud.r-project.org/. Here, you will find three options for installing R—click on the option for your computer’s operating system.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 If you are a Windows user:\n\nClick on “Download R for Windows”\nClick on “base”\nClick on the Download link.\nWhen you open the execution file (.exe) you will be prompted with a variety of questions about installing R. Feel free to use the default features / settings that come with R (continue to click “Ok” until the download starts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Versions of R\n\n\n\nBeware that if you had a previous version of R downloaded on your PC, that old version will not be deleted when you download the most recent version of R. We do not want to have two versions of R installed, as your computer can get confused what version of R to use. So, you need to remove the old version of R.\nTo do this you need to:\n\nNavigate to your computer’s settings\nClick on the “Apps” option on the left-hand panel\nSearch for or scroll down to R\nFind the older version of R\n\n\n\nClick on the ... on the right side\nSelect “Uninstall”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 If you are macOS user:\n\nClick on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”\nUnder “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of January 1, 2025 was R-4.5.2 (Not Part in a Rumble).\nWhen installing, use the default features / settings that come with R (click Ok until the download starts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting for Macs\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, identify which version of OSx you are running. How-to\nNext, find out which version of R your computer can run. Link\nIf this version is 3.6 or later, download the latest version that your computer can handle.\nIf this version is 3.4 or earlier, you’re going to run in to some trouble. I recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing. If you can’t, then you can use Posit Cloud to run R and RStudio on a free server. However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not be saved indefinitely, you will have limited hours to complete your work, your computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all times to do your work.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 If you are a Linux user:\nClick on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.",

Back in the dark ages, people wrote programs in text editors and then used the command line to compile those programs and run them. RStudio makes programming in R much easier and this course requires you to use it!\n\n\n\n\nDownloading the most recent version of RStudio works the same way regardless of whether you’ve never downloaded RStudio before or if you just need to update your version of RStudio.\nWhen you navigate to the RStudio download page (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), the website should automatically detect your computer’s operating system. So, you should be able to simply click the blue “Download RStudio Desktop for [insert operating system here]” button.\nClicking the button will begin installing RStudio.

    "text": "5.2 Creating Objects\nIt seems a bit silly to use R as a calculator when it can do so much more for us! A key aspect of working in R is the idea of storing values into objects. When storing a value into an object, your code will look something like this: x &lt;- 5\nBelieve it or not, there is a lot going on in this simple line of code. So, let’s break it down.\n\n\nx is the name of the object we are creating\n5 is the value we want to store inside x\n&lt;- is an operator that binds the name x to the value 5\n\nThe &lt;- works similar to an = sign, but we are specifically using an &lt;- because we believe it makes the action of assignment more explicit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice-exercisePractice Activity\n\n\n\nCreate two objects in your console, one named x which has the value 3 stored in it and one named y which has the value 4 stored in it.\n\n\nYou should have noticed when you created x and y that the values are not printed, they are just stored. If you want to view the value, you would need to type x to see its contents.\n\n5.2.1 Environment tab\nNow that you’ve created two objects, there are some interesting things to notice in the upper right corner. The Environment tab displays any objects which are defined in memory. Currently, both objects you’ve created should be labeled “Values”, but later on we will start to see objects labeled “Data” and “Functions”.",

    "text": "6.1 Scripts\nAn R script is a document that can store your code! Specifically, an R script is a plain text file whose entire purpose is to store R commands. Instead of typing code line-by-line into the console, we can write our code in a script, save it, and run it whenever we need.\nWorking in an R script has several advantages. First, it allows us to easily edit and fix mistakes without rewriting code from scratch. Second, scripts provide a complete record of the steps we took to perform an analysis, making our work easier to understand, reproduce, and share with others (or with our future selves!). Finally, scripts help us organize our code, encouraging clearer structure, comments, and good programming habits as our projects grow.\nLet’s create our first R script!\n\n6.1.1 Creating an R Script\nIn the upper left hand corner, you should see an image of a white sheet with a green plus sign. If you click this button you should see something like the image below:\n\nIf you click on the R Script option, a new file should appear and your RStudio should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice-exercisePractice Activity\n\n\n\nCreate an R Script in your RStudio!\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 The Editor Pane\nNow that we have a document to edit, we can see the fourth pane in RStudio—the editor pane. There are many different files we can create in RStudio. The logo in the top left of the document indicates the type of file we have open. An R script file has a blue circle with the letter R.\nLet’s start typing in the script, so we can explore some of the other buttons available to us.\n\n\n6.1.3 Running Code\nCopy the code below into your R script, so we can explore the various ways to run code.\na &lt;- 1\nb &lt;- 4\nc &lt;- a + b\n\nfname &lt;- \"Jane\"\nlname &lt;- \"Hollander\"\nNow that we have code in the script we can see that code numbers are provided on the left. This is a handy way to see where in the code the errors occur. There are a few ways to run code:\n\nplace your cursor on the line you want to run and click the run button\nplace your cursor on the line you want to run and hit Command + Enter (or Control + Enter)\n\nEither of these options will run the line of code that your cursor is on and then hop to the next line (if there is one).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice-exercisePractice Activity\n\n\n\nRun each of the five lines of code in your R script. Try both methods of running code and see which one you prefer!\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Saving Your R Script\nYou’ll notice that currently your script is labeled “Untitled1” that is because we haven’t saved the file anywhere. If we were to try and close our file before saving RStudio would tell us that our document had unsaved changes. Let’s save our document so we have access to it later on!\n You can save your file a few different ways. First, you can always use Command + S (or Control + S) to save a file. Second, you can click on the blue floppy disk immediately below your file name.\nEither of these options should open a popup menu for you to select where you want the script to be saved. Navigate to your stat-1810 folder that lives in your Documents folder. Change the file name to week-1.R.\n\n\n6.1.5 Files tab\nNow that you’ve saved your script, it should appear in the Files tab in the lower right corner. By default, the Files tab starts at your computer’s working directory (the hard drive). If we wanted to get to a specific file, we could click through the path to get to that file.\nTo get to the week-1.R file I needed to click through two folders:\n\nDocuments\nstat-1810",

    "section": "4.1 What makes R different?",
    "text": "4.1 What makes R different?\nR is a statistical programming language. Unlike more general-purpose languages, R is optimized for working with data and doing statistics. R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993 (hence “R”) and was formally released by the R Core Group in 1997 (a group of 20-ish volunteers who are the only people who can change the base, built-in functionality of R). If you want to build an independent, standalone graphical interface, or run a web server, R is probably not the ideal language to use (you might want C / Python or PHP / Python, respectively). If you want to vacuum up a bunch of data, fit several regression models, and then compare the models, R is a great option and will be faster than working in a more general-purpose language like C or base Python.\nOne thing to know about R is that it is open-source. This means that no company owns R (like there is for SAS or Matlab) and that developers cannot charge for the use of their R software. This does not mean that all of your code needs to be public (you can keep your code private), but it is important to be a good open-source citizen by sharing your code publicly when possible (in STAT 3820 you will learn about GitHub), contributing to public projects and packages, creating your own packages, and using R for ethical and respectful projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe History of R\n\n\n\nIf you would like to learn more about the history of R, here is an excellent article written by Roger Peng.",

    "text": "6.2 Writing Code for People\nWhile scripts are a great way to store our code, scripts often don’t make it easy for people to understand the processes enacted in the code. Yet, in almost every data science setting someone else will be reading your code. So, it is important to learn how to write readable code. As you become more proficient at programming, you will realize quickly that writing readable code is more challenging than writing working code but it is possibly just as important as getting a working solution.\n\n6.2.1 Code Comments\nOne way to make code easier to understand is the use of code comments. Since an R script can only contain R code, a code comment is your way of interweaving a written description into a script. Fundamentally, a code comment starts after a #. The # symbol indicates to R that this line of text should not be executed as code.\n\nDescriptive CommentsActionable Comments\n\n\nYou can use code comments to describe the actions taken by the code. Notice how each code comment below describes what is happening in the subsequent lines. Stylistically, it is important to have a space between the # and the text so the comment is easier to read.\n\n# Creating variables x and y\nx &lt;- 8\ny &lt;- 5\n\n# Creating z to depend on current values of x and y\nz &lt;- x + y\n\n\n\nYou can also use code comments to comment out a line of code, so it is not executed. Note that we are still using a space after the # to make the line of code (being commented out) easier to read.\n\n# Creating variables x and y\nx &lt;- 8\ny &lt;- 5\n\n# Creating z to depend on current values of x and y\n# z &lt;- x + y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHow many # to use?\n\n\n\nTechnically, you could use as many # as you want when making a code comment (e.g., #### Creating variables x and y). However, it is not recommended to use more than one # for consistency and readability.",

This type of data can be stored on the computer in multiple ways:\n\n\nas raw text, usually in a file that ends with .txt, .tsv, .csv, .dat, or sometimes, there will be no file extension at all.\n\n\n.csv “Comma-separated”\n\n.txt plain text - could be just text, comma-separated, tab-separated, etc.\n\n\n\nin a spreadsheet. Spreadsheets, such as those created by MS Excel, Google Sheets use a special type of markup that is specific to the filetype and the program it’s designed to work with. Therefore, special functionality is required for working with them in R.\n\n.xls\n.xlsx\n\n\n\nTo work with data in R, it’s important to know how to read in text files (CSV, tab-delimited, etc.). It can be helpful to also know how to read in XLSX files.\nNote: there are a lot of other ways to store data that we just won’t talk about in this class!\n\n5.2.2 File Paths\nBefore we can read in data, we need to tell R where to look for the data file!\nA file path describes where a certain file or directory lives on your computer. Any time that you are working in R, there is a working directory, which is the baseline directory that R is then looking for other files from. You can find your current working directory with:\n\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/czmann/Documents/r-revamp/course-pack\"\n\n\nThere are two different kinds of file paths that you can define to indicate the location of a file or directory:\n\nabsolute file path: full path from the root directory on your computer. Note this will only work on your computer!\nrelative file path: path based on the relationship with a current working directory in terms of a hierarchichy of directories\n\nLet’s look at an example of relative versus absolute file paths. In the example below the “labs” directory is the working directory. The directories that “labs” are in are called it’s parent directories, which are referenced with \"../\" in the relative file paths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSince absolute file paths only work on your computer, we will always use relative file paths in this course.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Reading in Data with readr and readxl\n\n\n\nread_csv() is for reading in .csv files\n\nread_txv() is for tab-separated data\n\nread_table() is for any data with “columns” (white space separating)\n\nread_delim() is for special “delimiters” separating data\n\nread_xlsx() is specifically for dealing with Excel files\n\n\n# load the readr package (or alternatively the tidyverse package)\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# here we are using a URL\nsurveys &lt;- read_csv(file = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earobinson95/stat331-calpoly/master/lab-assignments/Lab2-graphics/surveys.csv\")\n\n# here is an example of a relative file path to an actual data file!\nsurveys &lt;- read_csv(file = \"../data/surveys.csv\")",
