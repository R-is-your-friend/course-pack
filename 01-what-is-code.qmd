# Welcome to RStudio!

RStudio is the integrated development environment (IDE) we will be using to 
interact with R. RStudio is a very powerful environment that has lots of 
capabilities. We will learn many of these as we go, so right now we are going 
to focus on the most important aspects!

## RStudio Layout

When you open RStudio on your computer, you should get something that looks like 
the image below. You should see **three** panes, two on the right hand side and
one on the left. Let's learn what these do!

<!-- Need to update to not have the editor pane (since they won't have that open yet) -->

![Important locations and buttons in RStudio.](images/01-rstudio-three-pane-annotated.png){#fig-rstudio-three-pane fig-alt="A screenshot of an RStudio window highlighting the three different panes that open by default. The first pane (on the left hand side) is called the 'Console Pane.' This is the pane where the code you run shows up! In the upper right hand corner, there is the 'Environment and History Pane,' which is comprised of four tabs---Environment, History, Connections, and Tutorial. The Environment tab displays the objects that have been created in your code and the History tab displays a history of the code you've run. In the lower right corner there is the 'Files, Packages, and Help Pane,' which has six different tabs---Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer, and Presentations. The file tab is displayed in the image, showing that (by default), the files will show you your current working directory. For this computer, that current working directory is the Macbook Hard Drive (similar to a PC's C drive)."} 

On the left, you will find the Console pane. The Console is where you will see
your code execute! In the top right, you can find the Environment and History
tabs. These tabs show any objects you've created and a history of the code you
ran. In the bottom right, you will find the Files, Help, and Packages tabs. 
These tabs allow you to access files on your computer, install and load 
packages, and access documentation (help) pages for functions you might be 
trying to use.

<!-- You do not need to know what all of these tabs do right now. For the moment,  -->
<!-- it's enough to get a sense of the basics. You can see what code was run and the -->
<!-- output of the code in the bottom left), you can navigate to files in the  -->
<!-- bottom right, and you can monitor what objects were created by your code in the -->
<!-- top right. -->

# What is code?

# Running Code (in the Console)

When you open RStudio, the console pane should display information related to 
your R session. You should see something like the message displayed below. This
message tells you two things (1) R was successfully detected on your computer, 
and (2) the version of R with which you are working. 

<!-- We will need to update this to the current version of R in August! -->

```

::: {.callout-important}
If you don't see information related to your R session when you open RStudio
or RStudio tells you it doesn't detect R on your laptop you either forgot to
install R or installed it in an unexpected location.

## The Console Tab

It is possible to run code directly in the console! This code can be simple 
arithmetic like `2 + 2` or `3 * 6` or `6 - 4`. The output of each line is 
showed below (e.g, `[1] 4`). Next week we will learn what the `[1]` means with 
the output, so for now we will focus on the number that is output.

::: {.callout-practice-exercise}
Run these same three lines of code in your console.

## Creating Objects

It seems a bit silly to use R as a calculator when it can do so much more for 
us! A key aspect of working in R is the idea of storing values into objects. 
When storing a value into an object, your code will look something like this:
`x <- 5`

Believe it or not, there is a lot going on in this simple line of code. So, 
let's break it down. 

<!-- From Advanced R: the object, or value, doesn’t have a name; it’s actually the name that has a value. -->

- `x` is the name of the object we are creating
- `5` is the value we want to store inside `x`
- `<-` is an operator that binds the name `x` to the value `5`

The `<-` works similar to an `=` sign, but we are specifically using an `<-` 
because we believe it makes the action of assignment more explicit. 

::: {.callout-practice-exercise}
Create two objects in your console, one named `x` which has the value `3` stored
in it and one named `y` which has the value `4` stored in it.
:::

### Environment tab

Now that you've created two objects, there are some interesting things to 
notice in the upper right corner. The Environment tab displays any objects which
are defined in memory. Currently, both objects you've created should be labeled 
"Values", but later on we will start to see objects labeled "Data" and 
"Functions".

![](images/01-rstudio-environment-annotated.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the environment pane after creating the objects x and y. A Orange box is drawn around the names x and y with the annotation 'object name' and a second box is drawn around the values 3 and 4 with an annotation 'object value'. The screenshot also highlights the broom icon with a red box drawn around it, and an annotation indicating that this icon will remove all the objects from the environment."}

## The History Tab (Top Right)

Another useful tab in this pane is the History tab, which shows you a running
list of every command you've ever run. At this point you should have run 
(at least) five lines of code, all of which should be displayed in the history.

![](images/01-rstudio-history-annotated.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the history pane. This pane preserves all commands that have been run from the console or from evaluating code cells or scripts. The image highlights the broom icon in a red box and an accompanying annotation stating that this icon will clear the history (of the code that has been run)."}

<!-- ## Updating Objects -->

<!-- # Saving Your Code -->

<!-- ## Scripts -->

<!-- At one point, I wanted to keep a record of the temperature around my house so that I could examine how my heating bill changed with the temperature and determine if an upgrade to a heat pump was cost effective. I decided to record the outside temperature every 6 hours, writing that information to a file along with the date and time. This only required a few commands, but I wasn’t willing to commit to being at the computer every 6 hours for the rest of my life, and I wanted the data to be complete. -->

<!-- Enter scripts. -->

<!-- If you need to repeat the same analysis, or even just remember what commands you used, typing each command in each time is not ideal. A script is a text file which records a series of commands so that they can be run together. -->

<!-- Interactive mode is useful for quick, one-off analyses, but if you need to repeat an analysis (or remember what you did), interactive mode is just awful. Once you close the program, the commands (and results) are gone. This is particularly inconvenient when you need to run the same task multiple times. -->

<!-- To somewhat address this issue, most computing languages allow you to provide a sequence of commands in a text file, or a script. In many languages, scripts are intended to run on their own, from start to finish. We often call this executing a script, and this is typically done from a terminal prompt. -->

<!-- Scripts, and compiled programs generated from scripts, are responsible for much of what you interact with on a computer or cell phone day-to-day. When the goal is to process a file or complete a task in exactly the same way each time, a script is the right choice for the job. -->

<!-- Using scripts interactively allows us to see what is happening in the code step-by-step, and to examine the results during the program’s evaluation. This can be beneficial when applying a script to a new dataset, because it allows us to change things on the fly while still keeping the same basic order of operations. -->

<!-- You can run single lines of code within a script file by clicking on the line and using the “Run” button in RStudio, or by typing Ctrl/Cmd + Enter, which will run the selected line(s) of code in the Console. -->

<!-- ## The Editor/File Pane (Top Left) -->

<!-- The buttons and layout within this pane change based on the type of file you have open. -->

<!-- ::: panel-tabset -->
<!-- ### R script -->

<!-- ![The logo on the script file indicates the file type. When an R file is open, there are Run and Source buttons on the top which allow you to run selected lines of code (Run) or source (run) the entire file. Code line numbers are provided on the left (this is a handy way to see where in the code the errors occur), and you can see line:character numbers at the bottom left. At the bottom right, there is another indicator of what type of file Rstudio thinks this is.](../images/tools/Rstudio-editor-pane-buttons.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the RStudio editor window in R script mode. Lines are numbered along the left side. Editor style can be toggled between source and visual mode. There is a run button at the top to run the current or selected line(s), and an additional shortcut to source the script. An indicator in the bottom right tells you what kind of file you are looking at. In the bottom left, you can see the line:character that is being edited."} -->

<!-- ### Files tab -->

<!-- ![The files tab shows you the files in your current working directory (by default), though you can navigate through it and find other files as necessary. If you want to return to your working directory, there's a button for that in the "More" menu. One of the most important pieces of information in this pane is your path - you can construct the file path by using ~/ for home, and then for each folder, adding a slash between. The path to the folder we're looking at here is thus `~/Projects/Class/stat-computing-r-python/`.](../images/tools/Rstudio-file-tab.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of RStudio file tab, showing files, size, and last modified date. The folder path is shown just below the icon row and can be useful if you don't know where your files are located."} -->


<!-- ## Writing Code for People -->

<!-- One problem with scripts and interactive modes of using programming languages is that we’re spending most of our time writing code for computers to read – which doesn’t necessarily imply that our code is easy for humans to read. As you become more proficient at programming, you will realize quickly that writing readable code is more challenging than writing working code. It is hard to remember what a specific block of code did when you come back to it months after you wrote it! -->

<!-- There are two solutions to this problem, and I encourage you to make liberal use of both of them (together). -->

<!-- Code Comments -->

<!-- A comment is a part of computer code which is intended only for people to read. It is not evaluated or run by the computing language. -->

<!-- To “comment out” a single line of code in R or python, put a # (pound sign/hashtag) just before the part of the code you do not want to be evaluated. 

<!-- Examples of helpful code comments -->
