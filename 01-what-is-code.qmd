# Welcome to RStudio!

RStudio is the integrated development environment (IDE) we will be using
to interact with R. RStudio is a very powerful environment that has lots
of capabilities. We will learn many of these as we go, so right now we
are going to focus on the most important aspects!

## RStudio Layout

When you open RStudio on your computer, you should get something that
looks like the image below. You should see **three** panes, two on the
right hand side and one on the left. Let's learn what these do!

<!-- Need to update to not have the editor pane (since they won't have that open yet) -->

![Important locations and buttons in
RStudio.](images/01-rstudio-three-pane-annotated.png){#fig-rstudio-three-pane
fig-alt="A screenshot of an RStudio window highlighting the three different panes that open by default. The first pane (on the left hand side) is called the 'Console Pane.' This is the pane where the code you run shows up! In the upper right hand corner, there is the 'Environment and History Pane,' which is comprised of four tabs---Environment, History, Connections, and Tutorial. The Environment tab displays the objects that have been created in your code and the History tab displays a history of the code you've run. In the lower right corner there is the 'Files, Packages, and Help Pane,' which has six different tabs---Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer, and Presentations. The file tab is displayed in the image, showing that (by default), the files will show you your current working directory. For this computer, that current working directory is the Macbook Hard Drive (similar to a PC's C drive)."}

On the left, you will find the Console pane. The Console is where you
will see your code execute! In the top right, you can find the
Environment and History tabs. These tabs show any objects you've created
and a history of the code you ran. In the bottom right, you will find
the Files, Help, and Packages tabs. These tabs allow you to access files
on your computer, install and load packages, and access documentation
(help) pages for functions you might be trying to use.

## What makes R different?

R is a statistical programming language. Unlike more general-purpose languages,
R is optimized for working with data and doing statistics. R was created by Ross
Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993 (hence "R") and was formally released by the
**R Core Group** in 1997 (a group of 20-ish volunteers who are the *only* people
who can change the base, built-in functionality of `R`). If you want to build
an independent, standalone graphical interface, or run a web server, R is
probably not the ideal language to use (you might want C / Python or PHP /
Python, respectively). If you want to vacuum up a bunch of data, fit several
regression models, and then compare the models, R is a great option and will be
faster than working in a more general-purpose language like C or base Python.

One thing to know about `R` is that it is **open-source**. This means that no
company owns `R` (like there is for *SAS* or *Matlab*) and that developers
cannot charge for the use of their R software. This does not mean that all of
your code needs to be public (you can keep your code private), but it is
important to be a good open-source citizen by sharing your code publicly when
possible (in STAT 3820 you will learn about *GitHub*), contributing to public
projects and packages, creating your own packages, and using `R` for ethical and
respectful projects.

# The History of `R`

If you would like to learn more about the history of R, here is an [excellent article written by Roger Peng](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/history-and-overview-of-r.html).

# Running Code (in the Console)

When you open RStudio, the console pane should display information
related to your R session. You should see something like the message
displayed below. This message tells you two things (1) R was
successfully detected on your computer, and (2) the version of R with
which you are working.

<!-- We will need to update this to the current version of R in August! -->

```         
R version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31) -- "[Not] Part in a Rumble"

Type 'q()' to quit R.
```

::: callout-important
If you don't see information related to your R session when you open
RStudio or RStudio tells you it doesn't detect R on your laptop you
either forgot to install R or installed it in an unexpected location.
:::

## The Console Tab

It is possible to run code directly in the console! This code can be
simple arithmetic like `2 + 2` or `3 * 6` or `6 - 4`. The output of each
line is showed below (e.g, `[1] 4`). Next week we will learn what the
`[1]` means with the output, so for now we will focus on the number that
is output.

![](images/01-rstudio-console-annotated.png){fig-alt="An annotated screenshot of the RStudio console. The top of the image shows three tabs: Console, Terminal, Background Jobs. The Console tab is shown. Immediately below the Console tab you can see the R logo immediately next to the version of R that is being used (4.5.2). The top of the Console output shows the standard text related to R, the version number and name, the copywrite information, the license information, and how to cite R. After this you see a > character (indicating the start of a line of code) with 2+2 next to it. Immediately below this line is the output, displaying the number 4. The next line shows another > (indicating the start of another line of code) and 3*6. The output below this line shows 18. Finally, the third line of code (after another > character) shows 6-4, with an output of 2. The annotation says that the Console shows code that was run and that the > symbol means that R is ready to run code."}

::: callout-practice-exercise
Run these same three lines of code in your console.

## Creating Objects

It seems a bit silly to use R as a calculator when it can do so much
more for us! A key aspect of working in R is the idea of storing values
into objects. When storing a value into an object, your code will look
something like this: `x <- 5`

Believe it or not, there is a lot going on in this simple line of code.
So, let's break it down.

<!-- From Advanced R: the object, or value, doesn’t have a name; it’s actually the name that has a value. -->

-   `x` is the name of the object we are creating
-   `5` is the value we want to store inside `x`
-   `<-` is an operator that binds the name `x` to the value `5`

The `<-` works similar to an `=` sign, but we are specifically using an
`<-` because we believe it makes the action of assignment more explicit.

::: callout-practice-exercise
Create two objects in your console, one named `x` which has the value
`3` stored in it and one named `y` which has the value `4` stored in it.
:::

You should have noticed when you created `x` and `y` that the values are not
printed, they are just stored. If you want to view the value, you would need 
to type `x` to see its contents.

### Environment tab

Now that you've created two objects, there are some interesting things
to notice in the upper right corner. The Environment tab displays any
objects which are defined in memory. Currently, both objects you've
created should be labeled "Values", but later on we will start to see
objects labeled "Data" and "Functions".

![](images/01-rstudio-environment-annotated.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the environment pane after creating the objects x and y. A Orange box is drawn around the names x and y with the annotation 'object name' and a second box is drawn around the values 3 and 4 with an annotation 'object value'. The screenshot also highlights the broom icon with a red box drawn around it, and an annotation indicating that this icon will remove all the objects from the environment."}

## The History Tab (Top Right)

Another useful tab in this pane is the History tab, which shows you a
running list of every command you've ever run. At this point you should
have run (at least) five lines of code, all of which should be displayed
in the history.

![](images/01-rstudio-history-annotated.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the history pane. This pane preserves all commands that have been run from the console or from evaluating code cells or scripts. The image highlights the broom icon in a red box and an accompanying annotation stating that this icon will clear the history (of the code that has been run)."}

## Updating Objects

Currently, the values of `x` and `y` are `3` and `4` respectively, but
we might need to update their values. If we want to change the values of
`x` or `y`, we simply need to assign them new values.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: change-values

x <- 8
z <- x + y
y <- 5
```

::: callout-practice-exercise

Code tracing is a great technique for understanding what happens to an
object at each line of code. Use the table below to trace the values 
of `x`, `y`, and `z` for each of the three lines of code above.

<!-- Is there a way to make this interactive? -->
<!-- Maybe do multiple choice questions with webR? -->

| Line   | `x`    | `y`     | `z`                   |
|--------|:------:|:-------:|:---------------------:|
| Line 1 |        |  4      |   Does not exist      |
| Line 2 |        |         |                       |
| Line 3 |        |         |                       |

# Saving Your Code

This process of updating objects in the console seems a bit tedious and error 
prone. If we made a mistake we can't modify our previous code, so we will need
to write another line of code. Moreover, it would be a bit tedious to get a
history of all the code we ran. Enter R scripts! 

## Scripts

An R script is a document that can store your code! Specifically, an R script is
a plain text file whose entire purpose is to store R commands. Instead of typing
code line-by-line into the console, we can write our code in a script, save it,
and run it whenever we need.

Working in an R script has several advantages. First, it allows us to easily
edit and fix mistakes without rewriting code from scratch. Second, scripts
provide a complete record of the steps we took to perform an analysis, making
our work easier to understand, reproduce, and share with others (or with our
future selves!). Finally, scripts help us organize our code, encouraging clearer
structure, comments, and good programming habits as our projects grow.

Let's create our first R script!

### Creating an R Script

In the upper left hand corner, you should see an image of a white sheet with a 
green plus sign. If you click this button you should see something like the 
image below:

![](images/01-rstudio-create-script-annotated.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of RStudio showing how to create a new R script. The green “New File” button in the top-left toolbar is highlighted. Its dropdown menu is open, and the “R Script” option is highlighted, indicating that students should click “New File” and then select “R Script” to create a new script."}

If you click on the R Script option, a new file should appear and your RStudio 
should look something like this:

![](images/01-rstudio-r-script.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of a blank R script. In the top left corner, you can read the file name 'Untitled1'. Immediately below this, there are a few icons, a floppy disk (for saving the file), a check box saying 'Source on Save', a magnifying glass, and a magical wand. On the right hand side there are two other icons, Run (to run a line of code) and Source."}

::: callout-practice-exercise
Create an R Script in your RStudio!
:::

### The Editor Pane

Now that we have a document to edit, we can see the fourth pane in RStudio---the
editor pane. There are many different files we can create in RStudio. The 
logo in the top left of the document indicates the type of file we have open. 
An R script file has a blue circle with the letter R. 

Let's start typing in the script, so we can explore some of the other buttons 
available to us. 

### Running Code

Copy the code below into your R script, so we can explore the various ways to 
run code. 

```
a <- 1
b <- 4
c <- a + b

fname <- "Jane"
lname <- "Hollander"
```

Now that we have code in the script we can see that code numbers are provided on
the left. This is a handy way to see where in the code the errors occur. There
are a few ways to run code:

1. place your cursor on the line you want to run and click the [run button](images/01-rstudio-run-code.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the run button shown on the top right of the R script. The icon has a white box with a green arrow pointing to the right with the text saying 'Run' on the right."}

2. place your cursor on the line you want to run and hit Command + Enter (or
Control + Enter)

Either of these options will run the line of code that your cursor is on and
then hop to the next line (if there is one). 

::: callout-practice-exercise
Run each of the five lines of code in your R script. Try both methods of running
code and see which one you prefer!
:::

### Saving Your R Script 

You'll notice that currently your script is labeled "Untitled1" that is because
we haven't saved the file anywhere. If we were to try and close our file before
saving RStudio would tell us that our document had unsaved changes. Let's save 
our document so we have access to it later on!

![](images/01-rstudio-unsaved-changes.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the popup that appears when you attempt to close RStudio without saving your R script. The popup says 'The document Untitled1 has unsaved changes. Do you want to save these changes. The options provided are 'Save' (in blue), 'Don't Save', and 'Cancel.' The save button is what should be selected."}
You can save your file a few different ways. First, you can always use Command + S (or Control + S) to save a file. Second, you can click on the [blue floppy disk](images/01-rstudio-save.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the blue floppy disk icon that lives on the top left below the file name."} immediately below your file name. 

Either of these options should open a popup menu for you to select where you
want the script to be saved. Navigate to your `stat-1810` folder that lives in
your `Documents` folder. Change the file name to `week-1.R`.

### Files tab

Now that you've saved your script, it should appear in the Files tab in the
lower right corner. By default, the Files tab starts at your computer's working
directory (the hard drive). If we wanted to get to a specific file, we could 
click through the path to get to that file. 

To get to the `week-1.R` file I needed to click through two folders:

1. `Documents`
2. `stat-1810`

![](images/01-rstudio-file-path-annotated.png){fig-alt="A series of three screenshots demonstrating how to get to the week-1.R file saved in the stat-1810 folder. The first screenshot shows the 'Home' directory, which is similar to the C Drive on a PC. The Documents folder is outlined in red, as that is the folder that needs to be clicked on. The second screenshot shows the files stored in the Documents folder. There are six folders and the stat-1810 folder is highlighted in red. The third screenshot shows the week-1.R file which lives in the stat-1810 folder. At the top of the screenshot there is a red box highlighting the path to get to the week-1.R file (Home > Documents > stat-1810)."}

## Writing Code for People

While scripts are a great way to store our code, scripts often don't make it 
easy for people to understand the processes enacted in the code. Yet, in almost 
every data science setting someone else will be reading your code. So, it is 
important to learn how to write readable code. As you become more proficient at
programming, you will realize quickly that writing readable code is more
challenging than writing working code but it is possibly just as important as 
getting a working solution. 

### Code Comments

One way to make code easier to understand is the use of code comments. Since 
an R script can only contain R code, a code comment is your way of interweaving
a written description into a script. Fundamentally, a code comment starts after
a `#`. The `#` symbol indicates to R that this line of text **should not** be 
executed as code. 

::: {.panel-tabset}

# Descriptive Comments

You can use code comments to describe the actions taken by the code. Notice 
how each code comment below *describes* what is happening in the subsequent 
lines. Stylistically, it is important to have a space between the `#` and the
text so the comment is easier to read. 

```{r}
# Creating variables x and y
x <- 8
y <- 5

# Creating z to depend on current values of x and y
z <- x + y

```

# Actionable Comments

You can also use code comments to comment out a line of code, so it is not
executed. Note that we are still using a space after the `#` to make the line
of code (being commented out) easier to read.

```{r}
# Creating variables x and y
x <- 8
y <- 5

# Creating z to depend on current values of x and y
# z <- x + y

```
:::

::: {.callout-note}
# How many `#` to use?

Technically, you could use as many `#` as you want when making a code comment
(e.g., `#### Creating variables x and y`). However, it is not recommended to 
use more than one `#` for consistency and readability.
:::


# Exiting RStudio

Now that we've accomplished what we set out to do, we can close RStudio. When 
you try and close RStudio, you should get a message like the one below. You 
might wonder what this message means. Let us tell you!

![](images/01-rstudio-exit-message.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the message that appears when you attempt to close RStudio after running code. The message asks if you want to 'Save workspace image to ~/.Rdata?' with options Save, Don't Save, and Cancel."}

When you exit an R session, you’re faced with the question of whether or not to
save your workspace. The workspace is an image of all the objects you created
while you were working in R into a file called `.RData`. If you save your
workspace, when you reopen RStudio that workspace will be loaded and all the 
objects you created previously will be available to you. This might sound like
something you might want, but actually can cause some major headaches. 

Loading a saved workspace turns your R script from a program, where everything
happens based on a series of known steps, to something more akin to a 
cardboard box full of assorted pages and pictures that you don't remember where
they came from and why you made them. This has two major issues. First, this
action can clutter your workspace with lots of objects you don't need. Second,
the versions of the variables stored in your workspaces might be different from
what you want them to be (or think they are) and will cause issues in your code.

Fundamentally, you should never need to save your workspace because your
scripts should contain **all** the code you need to create the objects that you 
want to store. So, let's walk you through how to **never** save your workspace.

Click "Cancel" in the pop-up window above (with the message about saving the
workspace image). Now, at the top file menu for RStudio, click on Tools. In the
dropdown menu that appears, click on "Global Options". 

![](images/01-rstudio-global-options-annotated.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the menu that appears when you click on 'Tools' from the top menu of RStudio. At the bottom of the menu that appears, 'Global Options' is highlighted in red and blue indicating this is the option you want to select."}

In the menu that appears, you want to uncheck the box next to "Restore .RData
into workspace at startup." Next, you should select "Never" from the dropdown
menu next to "Save workspace to .RData on exit" (there are three options). Once
you've changed these options, click "OK" and the popup window should close. 

![](images/01-rstudio-save-rdata-annotated.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the popup window that appears after you select 'Global Options' from the previous menu. The popup window has A LOT of options, but there is a red box outlining the section we need to focus on. Under 'Workspace' there is a checkbox next to a line that says 'Restore .RData'. This box should be unchecked. The next line says 'Save workspace to .RData on exit.'. Next to this line there is a dropdown menu with three options: Always, Never, Ask. We need to change this option to 'Never'. Once these options have been modified, click on 'OK' to exit."}



Now, it is safe to exit RStudio!
