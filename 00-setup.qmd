# Computer is Friend

The theme of this lesson is understanding the difference between hardware and 
software, and where things are stored on your computer. In part two of the 
coursework, you will learn good practices for managing and storing files for 
this course. 

Before you learn how to program, it can be helpful to learn a few simple things
about how computers work. Modern computers hide a lot of the about where and how
files are stored, but later in the course when you start writing programs these
details will suddenly become very important.

# Hardware {#hardware}

The components that make up the physical computer are the **hardware**. This
3-minute video is focused on desktops, but the same components are commonly
found in laptops, cell phones, and even smart watches.

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rdm8E59L8Og >}}

::: {.callout-practice-exercise}
Examine the hardware on your computer using one of the following methods:

Windows: Ctrl+Shift+Escape > Task Manager > More Options > Performance tab

Mac: Apple menu > System Settings > General (sidebar) > About > System Report

<!-- Linux: The inxi command will give you most of this on the command line, and hwinfo --short will give you a considerably more detailed printout. -->

Find out:

- What processor do you have?
This most likely will start with ARM, Intel, AMD, or Apple M*

- How much RAM do you have? (most likely between 8 and 64 GB)

- How much hard drive space do you have?

## Operating Systems {#operating-systems}

Operating systems (OS), such as Windows and MacOS, are sophisticated programs that
allow CPUs to keep track of multiple programs and tasks and execute them at the
same time. This 2-minute video describes different operating systems.

Broadly, you should know (1) what operating system your computer uses
(Windows / Mac / Linux), and (2) what version of the system your computer uses
(e.g. Windows 11, Mac OSX Tahoe, Debian 12, RedHat 7).

::: {.callout-practice-exercise}
Locate your operating system and version information.
When was your system last updated?

If your system hasn't been updated in a while, consider updating it now. System
updates may break software you'll install to work with R in the next few weeks.

## File Systems {#file-systems}

File systems are places you save files (shocking!). These systems are modeled
after physical file cabinets, where documents are kept in a hierarchical 
sequence of folders. This collection of folders is what is stored on your 
hard drive. 

There has been a generational shift in how computers are used. Older users
(like me!) were taught to organize files deliberately, while many newer users
rely almost entirely on search, treating their computers less like filing
cabinets and more like laundry hampers.

Regardless of how you tend to organize your personal files, it is helpful to
understand the basics of what is meant by a computer **file system**--a way to
organize data stored on a hard drive.

### Local & Network File Systems

There are two primary types of file systems:

- **local file storage**, where files are physically stored on your computer's
disk. 

- **network file storage**, where files are stored "in the cloud" and you may
have a copy on your local machine.

We have noticed that more and more students have their files stored on 
cloud-based networks (e.g., Microsoft OneDrive, iCloud) rather than locally. In
fact, there seems to be a growing trend for files to be exclusively stored on a
cloud-based service rather than locally, and, unfortunately, it can be difficult
to override these defaults. 

When programming, it is essential to know where your files are being stored. 
In Week 4 when we start reading in data, you will not be able to interactively 
search for where the data are stored. Instead, you will need to know the exact 
location of the data on your computer. For this class, we strongly prefer for 
files to be stored **locally** because working "in the cloud" can cause strange
errors that are difficult to diagnose.

## File Paths {#file-paths}

It's not enough to know about a computer's file system, we also need to know how
computers remember the location of what is stored where. Specifically, we need
to understand **file paths**.

::: youtube-video-container
{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/BMT3JUWmqYY >}}
:::

When you write a program, you may have to reference external files - data
stored in a .csv file, for instance, or a picture. To reference a file, you have
to tell the computer where to look. Meaning, you need to give the computer a
**file path**. There are two types of file paths:

- **global file path**: Starts at the root of the file system location (e.g., 
`C:\` or `/home` or `/Users`) and describes how to navigate to the file from 
the root.

- **local file path**: Starts at the program's current location (e.g., 
`Documents`, `Desktop`) and navigates to the file from that location. 

The best practice for file storage is to create a folder that contains 
everything you need to run your entire project. This folder can (and should!) 
have sub-folders. This might look something like this:

```
- Documents
    - stat-1810
        + Week 1
            * Lecture
            * Lab
        + Week 2
            * Lecture
            * Lab
        + Week 3
            * Lecture
            * Lab
        + Week 4
            * Lecture
            * Project
        + .Rproj
```

For now, it is enough to know how to find files using file paths, and how to
refer to a file using a relative file path from your base folder. In this
example, the "base folder" would be `stat-1810`. In Week 4 we will learn about
RStudio projects (`.Rproj`), a tool for setting the base folder of a project
without having to write any code!

### Making Good File Names

You might have noticed a few things about how we chose to name the folders in 
the previous example. First, the main folder was named `stat-1810` not 
`Stat-1810` or `Stat 1810`. We made this choice for two reasons:

1. Some computers are case sensitive, so it is safer to use the same
capitalization for all folders. `stat` is easier to type than `Stat` or `STAT`. 

2. Using spaces in file names (e.g., `stat 1810`) can sometimes cause issues. 
So, we advocate for replacing spaces with a hyphon or an underscore.

A mellow, happy looking snake has text 'snake_case' along it."}

:::

Different operating systems (and file system formats) have different rules for how file names are handled within the file system.

|   | Windows {{< fa brands windows >}} | Mac OSX {{< fa brands apple >}} | Linux {{< fa brands linux >}} |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Disallowed Characters | `<`, `>`, `"`, `/`, `\`, `|`, `?`, `*` | `:`, some programs will restrict use of `/` . Avoid names that start with `.` unless the file should be hidden. | NULL character, `/` . Can't name files `.` or `..` . Avoid `\`, `"`, `'`, `*`, `;`, `?`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `~`, `!`, `$`, `<`, `>`, `#`, `@`, `&`, `|`, spaces, tabs, and newlines. Avoid names that start with `.` unless the file should be hidden. |
| Case Sensitive | No. `A.jpg` is the same as `a.JPG` | [It's complicated](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251191099?sortBy=rank). Act as if it's case sensitive to be safe. | Yes. `A.jpg` is different from `a.jpg` and `A.JPG` |
| Name Length | Entire file path should be \<256 characters[^01-computer-basics-4]. | (For HFS+ systems) File names \< 255 characters. File paths can be longer. | File names \< 255 characters, File paths \< 4096 characters (most file system options, including ext4) |

: File Naming Rules: Each operating system has characters that cannot be used and different behavior for case sensitivity. 

Now that we've learned about file paths and names, let's create a folder for 
this course!

::: {.callout-check-in}

Create a `stat-1810` folder in the `Documents` folder of your computer. Ensure
your folder is stored locally on your computer, **not** on OneDrive or iCloud!

Take a screenshot of your class directory, showing:

1.  the location of your `stat-1810` folder
2.  a Week 1 sub-folder
