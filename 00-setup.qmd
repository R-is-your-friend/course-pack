# Computer is Friend

The theme of this lesson is understanding the difference between hardware and 
software, and where things are stored on your computer. In part two of the 
coursework, you will learn good practices for managing and storing files for 
this course. 

Before you learn how to program, it can be helpful to learn a few simple things
about how computers work. Modern computers hide a lot of the about where and how
files are stored, but later in the course when you start writing programs these
details will suddenly become very important.

# Hardware {#hardware}

The components that make up the physical computer are the **hardware**. This
3-minute video is focused on desktops, but the same components are commonly
found in laptops, cell phones, and even smart watches.

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rdm8E59L8Og >}}

::: {.callout-practice-exercise}
Examine the hardware on your computer using one of the following methods:

Windows: Ctrl+Shift+Escape > Task Manager > More Options > Performance tab

Mac: Apple menu > System Settings > General (sidebar) > About > System Report

<!-- Linux: The inxi command will give you most of this on the command line, and hwinfo --short will give you a considerably more detailed printout. -->

Find out:

- What processor do you have?
This most likely will start with ARM, Intel, AMD, or Apple M*

- How much RAM do you have? (most likely between 8 and 64 GB)

- How much hard drive space do you have?
:::

## Operating Systems {#operating-systems}

Operating systems (OS), such as Windows and MacOS, are sophisticated programs that
allow CPUs to keep track of multiple programs and tasks and execute them at the
same time. This 2-minute video describes different operating systems.

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/RhHMgkUdhdk >}}
:::

Broadly, you should know (1) what operating system your computer uses
(Windows / Mac / Linux), and (2) what version of the system your computer uses
(e.g. Windows 11, Mac OSX Tahoe, Debian 12, RedHat 7).

::: {.callout-practice-exercise}
Locate your operating system and version information.
When was your system last updated?

If your system hasn't been updated in a while, consider updating it now. System
updates may break software you'll install to work with R in the next few weeks.

## File Systems {#file-systems}

File systems are places you save files (shocking!). These systems are modeled
after physical file cabinets, where documents are kept in a hierarchical 
sequence of folders. This collection of folders is what is stored on your 
hard drive. 

There has been a generational shift in how computers are used. Older users
(like me!) were taught to organize files deliberately, while many newer users
rely almost entirely on search, treating their computers less like filing
cabinets and more like laundry hampers.

Regardless of how you tend to organize your personal files, it is helpful to
understand the basics of what is meant by a computer **file system**--a way to
organize data stored on a hard drive.

### Local & Network File Systems

There are two primary types of file systems:

- **local file storage**, where files are physically stored on your computer's
disk. 

- **network file storage**, where files are stored "in the cloud" and you may
have a copy on your local machine.

We have noticed that more and more students have their files stored on 
cloud-based networks (e.g., Microsoft OneDrive, iCloud) rather than locally. In
fact, there seems to be a growing trend for files to be exclusively stored on a
cloud-based service rather than locally, and, unfortunately, it can be difficult
to override these defaults. 

When programming, it is essential to know where your files are being stored. 
In Week 4 when we start reading in data, you will not be able to interactively 
search for where the data are stored. Instead, you will need to know the exact 
location of the data on your computer. For this class, we strongly prefer for 
files to be stored **locally** because working "in the cloud" can cause strange
errors that are difficult to diagnose.

## File Paths {#file-paths}

It's not enough to know about a computer's file system, we also need to know how
computers remember the location of what is stored where. Specifically, we need
to understand **file paths**.

::: youtube-video-container
{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/BMT3JUWmqYY >}}
:::

When you write a program, you may have to reference external files - data
stored in a .csv file, for instance, or a picture. To reference a file, you have
to tell the computer where to look. Meaning, you need to give the computer a
**file path**. There are two types of file paths:

- **global file path**: Starts at the root of the file system location (e.g., 
`C:\` or `/home` or `/Users`) and describes how to navigate to the file from 
the root.

- **local file path**: Starts at the program's current location (e.g., 
`Documents`, `Desktop`) and navigates to the file from that location. 

The best practice for file storage is to create a folder that contains 
everything you need to run your entire project. This folder can (and should!) 
have sub-folders. This might look something like this:

```
- Documents
    - stat-1810
        + Week 1
            * Lecture
            * Lab
        + Week 2
            * Lecture
            * Lab
        + Week 3
            * Lecture
            * Lab
        + Week 4
            * Lecture
            * Project
        + .Rproj
```

For now, it is enough to know how to find files using file paths, and how to
refer to a file using a relative file path from your base folder. In this
example, the "base folder" would be `stat-1810`. In Week 4 we will learn about
RStudio projects (`.Rproj`), a tool for setting the base folder of a project
without having to write any code!

### Making Good File Names

You might have noticed a few things about how we chose to name the folders in 
the previous example. First, the main folder was named `stat-1810` not 
`Stat-1810` or `Stat 1810`. We made this choice for two reasons:

1. Some computers are case sensitive, so it is safer to use the same
capitalization for all folders. `stat` is easier to type than `Stat` or `STAT`. 

2. Using spaces in file names (e.g., `stat 1810`) can sometimes cause issues. 
So, we advocate for replacing spaces with a hyphen or an underscore.

A mellow, happy looking snake has text 'snake_case' along it."}

:::

Different operating systems (and file system formats) have different rules for how file names are handled within the file system.

|   | Windows {{< fa brands windows >}} | Mac OSX {{< fa brands apple >}} | Linux {{< fa brands linux >}} |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Disallowed Characters | `<`, `>`, `"`, `/`, `\`, `|`, `?`, `*` | `:`, some programs will restrict use of `/` . Avoid names that start with `.` unless the file should be hidden. | NULL character, `/` . Can't name files `.` or `..` . Avoid `\`, `"`, `'`, `*`, `;`, `?`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `~`, `!`, `$`, `<`, `>`, `#`, `@`, `&`, `|`, spaces, tabs, and newlines. Avoid names that start with `.` unless the file should be hidden. |
| Case Sensitive | No. `A.jpg` is the same as `a.JPG` | [It's complicated](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251191099?sortBy=rank). Act as if it's case sensitive to be safe. | Yes. `A.jpg` is different from `a.jpg` and `A.JPG` |
| Name Length | Entire file path should be \<256 characters[^01-computer-basics-4]. | (For HFS+ systems) File names \< 255 characters. File paths can be longer. | File names \< 255 characters, File paths \< 4096 characters (most file system options, including ext4) |

: File Naming Rules: Each operating system has characters that cannot be used and different behavior for case sensitivity. 

Now that we've learned about file paths and names, let's create a folder for 
this course!

::: {.callout-check-in}

Create a `stat-1810` folder in the `Documents` folder of your computer. Ensure
your folder is stored locally on your computer, **not** on OneDrive or iCloud!

Take a screenshot of your class directory, showing:

1.  the location of your `stat-1810` folder
2.  a Week 1 sub-folder

# Software

This course is all about you learning skills for working with data in R, so you
will need to have **local** installations of both R and RStudio on your
computer. Moreover, we will make use of Quarto documents, so you will need to 
have Quarto installed on your computer. 

::: callout-warning
# Cannot Install R or RStudio

If for any reason you cannot download R or RStudio onto your laptop, please let
me know as soon as possible so we can figure something out.

## What do I need to install?

It's a good idea to be skeptical when someone is telling you to install things.
🤨 Here's a very broad overview of what each of these programs or services
does and why I'm asking you to install or sign up for them.


| Program      | Logo          |    Purpose                                 |

## Installing `R`

<!-- I don't think we need to have instructions for updating R? -->

As mentioned above, you will need to have local installations of both R (the
software) and RStudio (the interface for working in R). ***Do not skip this step
if you already have both R and RStudio installed on your computer***, as you
need to ensure you are using the most up to date version of R and RStudio.

Download and install R by going to <https://cloud.r-project.org/>. Here, you
will find three options for installing R---click on the option for your
computer's operating system.

### If you are a *Windows* user:

-   Click on “Download R for Windows”

-   Click on “base”

-   Click on the Download link.

-   When you open the execution file (`.exe`) you will be prompted with a
variety of questions about installing R. Feel free to use the default features /
settings that come with R (continue to click "Ok" until the download starts).

::: callout-warning
# Multiple Versions of R

Beware that if you had a previous version of R downloaded on your PC, that old
version will not be deleted when you download the most recent version of R. We
do not want to have two versions of R installed, as your computer can get
confused what version of R to use. So, you need to remove the old version of R.

To do this you need to:

-   Navigate to your computer's settings
-   Click on the "Apps" option on the left-hand panel
-   Search for or scroll down to R
-   Find the older version of R

![](images/00-multiple-versions-of-r.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of a PC with two different versions of R installed---version 4.3.1 and version 4.4.1."}

-   Click on the `...` on the right side
-   Select "Uninstall"

![](images/00-uninstall-old-r-version.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of selecting the (...) option to uninstall the older version of R."}
:::

### If you are *macOS* user:

-   Click on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”

-   Under “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version
number. For example, the latest version of R as of January 1, 2025 was R-4.5.2
(Not Part in a Rumble).

-   When installing, use the default features / settings that come with R (click
Ok until the download starts).

# Troubleshooting for Macs

First, identify which version of OSx you are running. [How-to](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260)

Next, find out which version of `R` your computer can run. [Link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)

If this version is 3.6 or later, download the latest version that your computer
can handle.

If this version is 3.4 or earlier, you're going to run in to some trouble. I
recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing. If you can't, then
you can use [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) to run `R` and RStudio on a free
server. However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not
be saved indefinitely, you will have limited hours to complete your work, your
computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all
times to do your work.
:::

### If you are a *Linux* user:

Click on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more
information on installing `R` for your setup.

## Step 2: Install RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for `R`. What does that
mean? Well, if you think of `R` as a language, which it is, you can think of
RStudio as a program that helps you write and work in the language. Back in the
dark ages, people wrote programs in text editors and then used the command line
to compile those programs and run them. RStudio makes programming in `R` much
easier and this course requires you to use it!

::: {.column-margin}
{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrEe2TLr3MI >}}

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8kP7c_QbLA >}}
:::

Downloading the most recent version of RStudio works the same way regardless of
whether you've never downloaded RStudio before or if you just need to update
your version of RStudio. 

When you navigate to the RStudio download page
(<https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>), the website should
automatically detect your computer's operating system. So, you should be able to 
simply click the blue "Download RStudio Desktop for [insert operating system
here]" button. 

Clicking the button will begin installing RStudio. Once the download has
completed, you will need to open the application file (on a Mac this is a `.dmg`
file, on Windows this is an `exe` file).
